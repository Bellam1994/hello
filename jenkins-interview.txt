my past experince is  jenkins ,git,maven,chef 


what are using manul jenkins like installation configuration 

              build    pluging installation
ans:   we can intigrate  with the if you requried what every requried build  we have maven sonar then go head installing 
       
       pluging and automating process then bulid the configuration system location so that every time jenkins read the location

       then what ever requriement configure like git confingure clone the data from remote repository click on build now

      clone the data from remote repository like that bulid configure the in your jenkins machine.

4.how we can install pluging manual  

ans:  manual install the pluging first check the pluging like what exactlly jenkins version you going to use and then the 
        
        requried pluging after that before you going to jenkins environment first the best practise is install the pluging

        localy in the localy basically we use setup the jenkins and download the pluging and go to mange jenkins, manage plugins 

       there adavanced system setting and restart your jenkins environment so after that login jenkins set the pluging config

        so this the best pluging  every thing is working fine take the documentation for the  pluging installation once every
      thing working because many pepole doing the devlopment and we are  doing the bulid daily base.

2.for jenkin how we can backup  how we can take

     machine backup

ans: so basically coming to the backup  we are using two method one is the config.xml file located in your jenkins host machine

       we can use the pluging that is backup config pluging that is working how is install the configure we have give the backup 

      configure root directory and backup directory and formate backup job using the pluging we can take up backup also and

     jenkins backup pluging configure system there is backup configure option if you  required the backup you can take backup.

3.configure file in home directory

ans:  jenkins home directory you can take backup that evert thing pluging job 

4  configure email notification using jenkins

 ans: install jenkins 
        
      open jenkins on local host.setting up an   SMTP SERVER  ,navigate to mange jenkins(mange jenkins option is displayed on

      the right hand side of the server)

      once on the mange jenkins page,select the manage plugin option.

       click avaliable tab on the mange pluging page on the filter filed displayed on the right hand corner on the screen ,
     
       start typing notification click on the check box next to email 

       now click the check box next to email exec plugiNG click the install without restart button.


     email notification:

        mange jenkins  then go to

          configure system   then go to

 	email notification:SMPT server .SMTP .gmail.com  465 PORT NO


 add an email notification for a build project.

Step 1 - Configuring an SMTP server. Goto Manage Jenkins ? Configure System. Go to the E-mail notification section and 
         enter the required SMTP server and user email-suffix details.

SMTP Server
Step 2 - Configure the recipients in the Jenkins project - When you configure any Jenkins build project, 
           right at the end is the ability to add recipients who would get email notifications for unstable or broken builds. 
              Then click on the Save button.

Configure Recipients
Apart from the default, there are also notification plugin’s available in the market. 
 An example is the notification plugin from Tikal Knowledge which allows sending Job Status  
 notifications in JSON and XML formats. This plugin enables end-points to be configured as shown below.

     artifactory and deploy package to the dev environment and deploy package to the stage environment this complete pipeline

   there is total 8 stage we implimented the struture of the pipeline is first we should maintind the label ,git checkout we clone

   the data and branch name url clone is data , 3 rd stage code scan we are using sonar cube bascially we are doing the analisis

  in the code quality once its completeed go for the doing the uplod package artifactory once is completed testing .before 

  we use buliding every stage propely configure after that we can move for the doing ci/cd process.

6 deployment like   

	chef process in jenkins

ans: deployment perform we intigrated the process configuration mangement tool chef basically in jenkins job only configure 

      the recipe is locatedS in your chef location basically if you recipe configure intigration in jenkins you see the recipe name
